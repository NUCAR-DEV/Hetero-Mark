## PageRank

A Benchmark Suite for Heterogeneous System Computation
PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their
 search engine results. It is a link analysis algorithm and it assigns a
 numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents,
 such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative
 importance within the set. So the computations are representatives of graph
 based applications.
